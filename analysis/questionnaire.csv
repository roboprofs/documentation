I have to admit that the lectures incorporated a lot of information, which (because it is arbitrary) was hard to connect to other experiences I have and therefore increased the difficulty. On a personal note I would say, that I usually would repeat everything if I have to make a test afterwords, but I tried to only do so if I really needed during the experiment. In a normal situation I would have written down the information and asked myself about it to remember it. So overall I think the test was quite tough for me, without saying that the robot is at center of the problem."
